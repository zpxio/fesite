intro: >-
  This is a derivative of an old recipe originally designed for waffles. The result is something that some pancake
  purists refuse to accept, but most normally people enjoy for their fluffy texture.

    steps:
      - Preheat a griddle to 350 degrees F.
      - Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl.

        Combine the wet ingredients in a slightly smaller bowl. No need to mix in all the milk. The real goal is just
        to pre-mix enough of the yolk, oil, and vanilla that it doesn’t get weird when it combines with the flour.
      - Beat the egg whites to stiff, but not dry peaks. Leave in the bowl for now.

        Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients. Pour in the wet ingredients and combine vigorously enough to
        make you feel better about your day. No need to make a smooth batter, but you’ll want to get rid of the large
        lumps.
      - Moving reasonably quickly, fold the beaten egg whites with the not-completely-smooth batter. Keep folding until there are no more egg-white “chunks”. This makes it sound rather un-appetizing. Put that out of your mind and continue to the next step.
      - Spoon the batter onto the griddle about ⅓ cup per pancake.
